### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Stallacktit, a junior dotnet developper. I'm curious and always willing to learn more! 
Aged 24 and freshly graduated, I'm working in a small tech company in Belgium in a motivating development team!
Native french speaker, I can also communicate using English and Dutch language.
Open to the world and other cultures. Talk me about yourself!

Here are some updates about me: 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an ANTLR project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# Dotnet
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Jet connectors
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about music, tech, whatever you want
